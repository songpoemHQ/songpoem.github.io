## Use Cases of Asset Tokenization
### Real Estate Tokenization
Tokenize ownership of commercial and residential properties, enabling fractional ownership and increasing liquidity in traditionally illiquid markets. Investors can buy and sell fractions of a property, opening up new investment opportunities.

### Artwork and Collectibles
Tokenization of high-value art, collectibles, and luxury goods allows for fractional ownership and easier trading. This enables smaller investors to gain exposure to assets that would typically require significant capital.

### Supply Chain Management
Tokenize assets within a supply chain (e.g., raw materials, finished goods), creating a more transparent and secure way to track product ownership and provenance across the entire supply chain.

### Commodities and Natural Resources
Tokenization of commodities like gold, oil, or agricultural products allows for easier trading and increases access to a broader range of investors by reducing barriers to entry through fractional ownership.

### Intellectual Property (IP) Rights
By tokenizing IP rights, owners of patents, trademarks, or copyrights can sell fractional interests in their intellectual property, providing a new way to raise capital or expand business opportunities.

## Technology Stack
### Blockchain Protocols:
Hyperledger, Ethereum (ERC741, ERC3643), Solana

### Programming Languages:
Rust, Solidity, Python, Golang
